The lobo, beloved mascot of the university, exists in many iterations across the campus. Fill in about the lobo as the mascot and how it came to be. [^note1]

## Lobo In Tight Grove

Surveilling the corner of Central and University, you'll find the university's iconic lobo statue among a grove of pine trees. The statue, a gift from the Alumni Association in 1997, commemorates the centennial of the school. It is situated among a grove of trees originally transplanted by students in 1908. Tight Grove, named after the president of the university at the time, consists mainly of pine trees and Rio Grand Cottonwoods. The statue has stood among these trees for nearly three decades now, forming a part of the modern campus that most visitors are sure to be familiar with.

## John Tatschl's _Lobo_ 

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" caption="Lobo statue by John Tatschl. Source" src="images/lobo-image-1.jpg" %} 

Perhaps the most well-known of the series of lobo statues across the campus, John Tatschl's _Lobo_ currently stands outside of Johnson Center near the entrance at Stanford and Central. Tatschl, an Austrian artist and professor began his career at the university in 1946. During his tenure, he produced many of the public art displays we are familiar with on campus including the multi-story sculpture that ascends the main stairwell of Zimmerman Library, The History of Writing, the colorful glass wall of the College of Education Building (formerly Travelstead Hall), as well as the design for the altar screens inside the Alumni Memorial Chapel.

### Bronze Lobos Across Campus
There are a handful of other lobo statues scattered across campus. In various poses, you can find them lurking around the bushes and trees. The statues were donations to the university during the 2013, verify, _Spirit of the Lobo_ campaign. 

Now we have a text box scrolling up over the image. At various points (clearly labeled in the following text) **the background image will switch.**
