## Lobo In Tight Grove

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" height="100" caption="Sculpture Dedication. December 8, 1997." src="images/lobo-tight-grove-5.jpg"%} 

Surveilling the corner of Central and University, you'll find one of the university's lobo statues situated among a grove of pine trees. Tight Grove, named for then-University President William George Tight, is formed of pine trees and Rio Grande Cottonwoods transplanted from the Sandia Mountains and foothills by students in 1908. The lobo welcomes visitors and passersby to the campus. 

The statue, a gift from the Alumni Association in 1997, commemorates the Alumni Association's 100th anniversary. It is situated among a grove of trees originally transplanted by students in 1908. Tight Grove, named after the president of the university at the time, consists mainly of pine trees and Rio Grande Cottonwoods. The statue has stood among these trees for nearly three decades now, forming a part of the modern campus that most visitors are sure to be familiar with.

# John Tatschl's _Lobo_

Perhaps the most well-known of the series of lobo statues across the campus, John Tatschl's _Lobo_ currently stands outside of Johnson Center near the entrance at Stanford and Central. Tatschl, an Austrian artist and professor, began his career at the university in 1946. During his tenure, he produced many of the public art displays we are familiar with on campus including the multi-story sculpture that ascends the main stairwell of Zimmerman Library, The History of Writing, the colorful glass wall of the College of Education Building (formerly Travelstead Hall), as well as the design for the altar screens inside the Alumni Memorial Chapel.

Tatschl's Lobo has made many homes across campus throughout its nearly 80 years. Originally placed outside Zimmerman Stadium, it was moved following the stadium's relocation and demolition in the 1960s. His second home, near the Stanford and Central entrance, welcomed students and visitors from the median. It currently resides between Johnson Center and Johnson Field on the east side of the building. 

### Hodgin Hall Lobo
