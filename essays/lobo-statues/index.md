# The Lobo

The lobo, beloved mascot of the university, can be spotted in many places around the campus. Fill in about the lobo as the mascot and how it came to be. 

## Lobo In Tight Grove

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" height="100" caption="Sculpture Dedication on Dec 8, 1997. [^note1] [^note1]: Center for Southwest Research. UNMA 028 Box 60" src="images/lobo-tight-grove-5.jpg" %} 

Surveilling the corner of Central and University, you'll find the university's iconic lobo statue situated among a grove of pine trees. The statue, a gift from the Alumni Association in 1997, commemorates the school's centennial. It is situated among a grove of trees originally transplanted by students in 1908. Tight Grove, named after the president of the university at the time, consists mainly of pine trees and Rio Grande Cottonwoods. The statue has stood among these trees for nearly three decades now, forming a part of the modern campus that most visitors are sure to be familiar with. 

The Lobo in Tight Grove Sculpted by Michelle Middleton. Casted by Richard Wortman.

# John Tatschl's _Lobo_ 

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" caption="Lobo statue by John Tatschl. Source" src="images/lobo-image-1.jpg" %} 

Perhaps the most well-known of the series of lobo statues across the campus, John Tatschl's _Lobo_ currently stands outside of Johnson Center near the entrance at Stanford and Central. Tatschl, an Austrian artist and professor, began his career at the university in 1946. During his tenure, he produced many of the public art displays we are familiar with on campus including the multi-story sculpture that ascends the main stairwell of Zimmerman Library, The History of Writing, the colorful glass wall of the College of Education Building (formerly Travelstead Hall), as well as the design for the altar screens inside the Alumni Memorial Chapel.

Perhaps the most well-known of the series of lobo statues across the campus, John Tatschl's _Lobo_ currently stands outside of Johnson Center near the entrance at Stanford and Central.

#### Construction of the Lobo

### Dedication 
Tatschl's _Lobo_ is dedicated to the students and alumni who lost their lives during WWI and WWII. The statue was erected in 1947 shortly after the conclusion of the Second World War. A placard below the statues acknowledges those who died.


### Locations
{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="48%" height="100" caption="The Lobo in his current location [Source](https://econtent.unm.edu/digital/collection/ULPhotoImag/id/2667/rec/73)" src="images/lobo-image-8.jpg" %} 

The statue was originally placed outside Zimmerman Stadium. After the stadium's relocation to University and Cesar Chavez in the 1960s, the lobo was moved to preside over the Stanford and Central entrance to campus. He has made his most recent home outside of Johnson Center near the east entrance, adjacent to Johnson Field.

## Bronze Lobos Across Campus
There are a handful of other lobo statues scattered across campus. In various poses, you can find them lurking around the bushes and trees. The statues were donations to the university during the 2013, verify, _Spirit of the Lobo_ campaign.
