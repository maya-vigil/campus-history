# The Lobo

Among the numerous public art installations on campus, you'll encounter more than a few representations of the University's mascot, the Lobo. First suggested in 1920, the Lobo is a recognizable and beloved school symbol, representing teamwork and fearlessness.[^note1] Let's take a tour of the statues around campus.

## Lobo In Tight Grove

Where might you encounter a real Lobo? While it is unlikely you'll ever stumble across a Mexican grey wolf in the wild, you _can_ find them in the mountain ranges of New Mexico. But, with a bit of wonder, you can imagine encountering one in its natural habitat with a visit to the Lobo in Tight Grove. Situated among century-old ponderosa pines, you'll find the UNM Lobo surveilling the corner of University and Central. The statue, sculpted by Michelle Middleton and cast by Richard Wortman, was a gift from the Alumni Association in 1997 to commemorate its 100th anniversary. 

In a man-made forest on the edge of campus created by transplanting ponderosas and Rio Grande Cottonwoods from the Sandia Mountains in 1905 by students and then-University President William George Tight, the lobo finds its home, welcoming visitors and passersby to the campus.

The oldest of the series of lobo statues, John Tatschl's _Lobo_ currently stands outside of Johnson Center. Tatschl, an Austrian artist and professor, began his career at the university in 1946. During his tenure, he produced many of the public art displays on campus including _The History of Writing_, the multi-story sculpture that ascends the main stairwell of Zimmerman Library, the colorful glass wall of the College of Education Building (formerly Travelstead Hall), as well as the design for the altar screens inside the Alumni Memorial Chapel.

Perhaps the most well-known of the series of lobo statues across the campus, John Tatschl's _Lobo_ currently stands outside of Johnson Center near the entrance at Stanford and Central. Tatschl, an Austrian artist and professor began his career at the university in 1946. During his tenure, he produced many of the public art displays we are familiar with on campus including the multi-story sculpture that ascends the main stairwell of Zimmerman Library, The History of Writing, the colorful glass wall of the College of Education Building (formerly Travelstead Hall), as well as the design for the altar screens inside the Alumni Memorial Chapel.

Tatschl's Lobo has made many homes across campus throughout its nearly 80 years. Originally placed outside Zimmerman Stadium, it was moved following the stadium's relocation and demolition in the 1960s. His second home, near the Stanford and Central entrance, welcomed students and visitors from the median. It currently resides between Johnson Center and Johnson Field on the east side of the building. 

### Hodgin Hall Lobo

An additional version of Tatschl's Lobo can be seen in the oversized recasting of the lobo's head outside of Hodgin Hall.
